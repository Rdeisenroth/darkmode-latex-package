# darkmode LaTeX Package
The **darkmode** Package provides an API for template and package developers to create
dynamic color schemes for light- and darkmodes. For those unaware: We refer to *dark
mode* when a document has a dark background with a light font and to *light mode* if it
has a dark font with a light background.
